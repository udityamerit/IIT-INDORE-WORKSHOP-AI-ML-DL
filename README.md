# NLTK Project

This project utilizes the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) for various natural language processing (NLP) tasks. NLTK is a powerful Python library that provides easy-to-use interfaces to over 50 corpora and lexical resources, along with a suite of text processing libraries.

## Installation

To get started with this project, you need to have Python installed on your machine. You can then install the necessary dependencies using `pip`.

```bash
pip install nltk
```

After installing NLTK, you might want to download some of the essential NLTK datasets. This can be done within a Python script or an interactive Python session.

```python
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('stopwords')
```

## Usage

### Basic Commands

Below are some basic NLTK commands that you might find useful:

- **Tokenization**: Splitting text into individual words or sentences.
  
  ```python
  from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize, sent_tokenize

  text = "Hello world! How are you?"
  words = word_tokenize(text)
  sentences = sent_tokenize(text)

  print(words)
  print(sentences)
  ```

- **Stemming**: Reducing words to their root forms.
  
  ```python
  from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer

  stemmer = PorterStemmer()
  word = "running"
  stemmed_word = stemmer.stem(word)

  print(stemmed_word)
  ```

- **Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base forms (lemma).
  
  ```python
  from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer

  lemmatizer = WordNetLemmatizer()
  word = "running"
  lemma = lemmatizer.lemmatize(word, pos="v")

  print(lemma)
  ```

### Working with Corpora

NLTK provides access to various corpora that you can use in your projects. Here's how you can load and use them:

```python
from nltk.corpus import gutenberg

# Load a specific text from the Gutenberg corpus
text = gutenberg.raw('austen-emma.txt')
print(text[:100])  # Print the first 100 characters
```

### Text Processing

You can also perform various text processing tasks, such as removing stopwords or performing part-of-speech tagging.

- **Removing Stopwords**:
  
  ```python
  from nltk.corpus import stopwords

  stop_words = set(stopwords.words('english'))
  filtered_words = [word for word in words if word.lower() not in stop_words]

  print(filtered_words)
  ```

- **Part-of-Speech Tagging**:
  
  ```python
  from nltk import pos_tag

  tagged_words = pos_tag(words)
  print(tagged_words)
  ```

## Examples

Here are some examples of what you can do with NLTK:

- Sentiment Analysis
- Named Entity Recognition
- Text Classification
- Language Modeling
